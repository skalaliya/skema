Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator
This simple Python script calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input. It serves as an introductory example for beginners to understand basic concepts in Python programming, such as functions, user input, calculations, and error handling.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the script on your local machine for learning and development purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your computer
A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode, PyCharm, or any other of your choice.
Running the Script
Clone the Repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rectangle_chandan.git
Navigate to the Directory:
sh
Copy code
cd rectangle_chandan
Run the Script:
sh
Copy code
python rectangle_chandan.py
How It Works
The script defines a function rectangle() which performs the following steps:

Prompts the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle.
Calculates the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Prints the calculated area and perimeter.
The script also includes error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

Example Usage
sh
Copy code
Enter the length of the rectangle: 5
Enter the breadth of the rectangle: 3
The area of the rectangle is 15.0 square units.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 16.0 units.
Code Explanation
python
Copy code
def rectangle():
    """
    This function prompts the user to enter the length and breadth of a rectangle,
    then calculates and prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
    """
    try:
        length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
        breadth = float(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))
        
        # Calculate area
        area = length * breadth
        
        # Calculate perimeter
        perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
        
        # Print the results
        print(f"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.")
        print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter} units.")
    
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter numerical values for length and breadth.")

# Call the rectangle function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rectangle()
Key Points:
Function Definition: rectangle() function encapsulates the logic for area and perimeter calculation.
User Input: The input() function is used to take user input.
Error Handling: The try-except block handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.
Formatted Output: The print() function with f-strings is used for clear and readable output.
Main Guard: if __name__ == "__main__": ensures that the function runs only when the script is executed directly.
